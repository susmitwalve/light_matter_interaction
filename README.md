The project involves computationally simulating the formation of beam pattern in a four-level atomic system. In this report the parameters used are for the atomic system of 87Rb vapor. The theoretical formulation is based on the time evolution of density matrix equations. The equations have been initially solve analytically in the weak-field limit using perturbative expansion. Following that, I have also solved the equations numerically. Finally, the solution of these equations has been used for simulating the propagation of a Laguerre-Gaussian beam in the medium.
